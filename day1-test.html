            Hi! This is day 2 of learning HTML!
        </h1>

            I made this site from scratch without using any resources to <b>check</b> if I remember what I learned <sup>yesterday!</sup>
        </h3>
        <p>
            It's a little bit annoying because the VS Code tries to auto-complete all the code for me, but I don't need it!
